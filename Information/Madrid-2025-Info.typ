= Greetings!

Welcome to CodeChella Madrid. We had so much fun last year that we want to do it again! This document contains the essential information you'll need for this workshop. 

If you still have questions after looking through this document, then please do not hestiate to email any questions. There are three people you can contact, but typically you should email Scott and Kyle. Additionally, our local host is Agustín an associate professor at CUNEF Universidad. There may be some questions better asked to him, but we can cc him if needed. Our emails are as follows:

  [Agustín Casas Lupiáñez], [#link("acasas@cunef.edu")],
)


= Course Material

The entire course material will be hosted on a github repository https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Madrid-2025. You can see last year's material https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Madrid-2025 to get a sense of what we're going to work on!!

During the workshop, we will have live coding portions where we will ask attendees to try coding up these estimators themselves and try out interactive apps. For this reason, we recommend everyone bring their laptops to the workshops. 

= Discord

We will be using discord during this workshop. We will monitor the discord during the workshop for any questions that may be off-topic but you want to ask about. But more importantly, we want people to be able to meet one another and make plans for dinner and things like that. So, I recommend joining early and saying hi in the `#meeting-eachother` channel! To join, use this link: TBD.


= Coffee and Food 

Each morning of the workshop at 10:30am, fresh coffee and pastries will be provided outside the auditorium. Lunch will take place from 1 — 2:30pm each day. You grab a bite either at the campus cafeteria or head to the surrounding area. On Wednesday, food is generously being provided by CUNEF Universidad for us. A lot of restaurants are to the south on Av. de la Reina Victoria and to the East.

= Schedule

This is our tentative schedule. Note that on Wednesday, May 29th, we will be going to a different lecture hall. The reason is that on this day, lunch will be provided for attendees by CUNEF Universidad.
